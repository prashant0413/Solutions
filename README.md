Welcome to the **Solutions** repository! This project serves as a comprehensive collection of my solutions to various algorithmic problems and competitive programming challenges from major platforms.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by platform into specific directories:

- **[`CodeForces-Questions`](./CodeForces-Questions)**: Solutions to problems from CodeForces contests and problem sets.
- **[`Leetcode-Questions`](./Leetcode-Questions)**: Solutions to daily challenges and standard problems from LeetCode.
- **[`GeeksForGeeks`](./GeeksForGeeks)**: Solutions to problems hosted on GeeksForGeeks (POTD, practice problems, etc.).

## 🛠️ Languages Used

The majority of solutions are implemented in:
- **C++** (Primary)
- **Java**
